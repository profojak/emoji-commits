  <code>  emoji [optional scope] Commit message title  </code><br><br>
</div>

Start your commit message with an emoji from the table, corresponding to the
action you intend the commit to make.  If you are unsure, check if your commit
is <a href="https://www.aleksandrhovhannisyan.com/blog/atomic-git-commits/">
atomic</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/profojak/emoji-commits/issues/new">
open an Issue</a> and let's discuss!

Optionally, provide a scope with additional contextual information inside
`[ ]` brackets.  Unless the commit change is global or difficult to assign, the
scope refers to a section of the project.  You set the rules.

Write a title of the commit.  Start with a verb in imperative, as if you were
giving an order.  Ommit `a`, `an`, `the` articles to save characters.
Capitalize the first letter and end without `.` period.  Try to keep the title
<a href="https://cbea.ms/git-commit/#limit-50">reasonably short</a>.

Optionally, continue with a longer body.  Desribe the
<a href="https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/quasiblog/commit-messages/">
reasons and changes</a>.  Prefer verbs in imperative, and fully qualified URLs
to link to issues, commits, etc.  Hard wrap the text to
<a href="https://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html">
72 characters</a>, but do not wrap atypical text such as URLs, code, terminal
output, etc.

Optionally, end with a
<a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/SubmittingPatches#commit-trailers">trailer</a>
footer.  List each trailer on a separate line.  Separate keys from values with
`:` colon and a single space.

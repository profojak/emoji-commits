                  emoji [optional scope] Commit message title

  Start your commit message with an emoji from the table, corresponding to the
  action you intend the commit to make.  If you are unsure, check if your commit
  is atomic, or open an Issue and let's discuss!

  Optionally, provide a scope with additional contextual information inside
  `[ ]` brackets.  Unless the commit change is global or difficult to assign,
  the  scope refers to a section of the project.  You set the rules.

  Write a title of the commit.  Start with a verb in imperative, as if you
  were giving an order.  Ommit `a`, `an`, `the` articles to save characters.
  Capitalize the first letter and end without `.` period.  Try to keep the
  title reasonably short.

  Optionally, continue with a longer body.  Desribe the reasons and changes.
  Prefer verbs in imperative, and fully qualified URLs to link to issues,
  commits, etc.  Hard wrap the text to 72 characters, but do not wrap atypical
  text such as URLs, code, terminal output, etc.

  Optionally, end with a trailer footer.  List each trailer on a separate line.
  Separate keys from values with `:` colon and a single space.
